Given RSA with N = p*q where both p and q use only digits {6,7} and end with 7.
So p ≡ 7 (mod 10), q ≡ 7 (mod 10).

Use the fact that the last k digits of a product depend only on the last k digits of the factors.

Build p and q from least significant digit using DFS:

Start with p = 7, q = 7

At each step append 6 or 7 to p and q

Check (p*q) mod 10^k == N mod 10^k

If not matching, backtrack

Continue until a full p is found such that p divides N.

Compute q = N / p.

Compute φ(N) = (p−1)(q−1) and d = e⁻¹ mod φ(N).

Decrypt m = c^d mod N and convert to bytes to get the flag.
