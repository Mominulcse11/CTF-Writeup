Steps to solve:

The flag is first converted into phonetic words.

The phonetic conversion is applied twice.

The resulting string is split into bigrams.

Each plaintext bigram is replaced by a random ciphertext bigram using a fixed substitution.

The flag prefix is known:
lactf{

Start with the known prefix:
flag = "lactf{"

Convert this prefix into phonetic form (twice).

Build bigrams from the phonetic string.

Match these bigrams with the given ciphertext bigrams.

Use DFS/backtracking to extend the flag character by character:

For each next character, generate its phonetic expansion

Check bigram consistency with ciphertext

Maintain a cipher-to-plain bigram mapping

Backtrack if any conflict occurs

Continue until the full flag is recovered.

Flag:
